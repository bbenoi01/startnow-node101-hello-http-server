Project Description:

This is a very simple Hello World Node JS project. This was my first exposure to creating a very simple web server that will only respond to a basic request for localhost:8080. The server will also log each request to the console.

How to open:

Using the command prompt, copy and paste 'code ~/oca/startnow-node101-hello-http-server' and push enter. This will open the project in visual studio code. To start and test this application, run 'node index.js' in Terminal.
